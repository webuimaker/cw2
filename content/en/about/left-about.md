Previously, I studied at Pembroke College, Oxford University and Tufts University, where I graduated summa cum laude with a double major in Economics and Environmental Studies. I was also selected a [Tufts Senior Award Winner](https://alumniandfriends.tufts.edu/join-our-community/about-alumni-association/2019-senior-awards-honorees)  and inducted into the [Phi Betta Kappa](https://ase.tufts.edu/pbk/index_files/Page352.htm) honors society.
