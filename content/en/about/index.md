<div class="columns-4 w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6"><p class="body-light">I'm a freelance UX designer specializing in food, technology, and the circular economy. A few (quarantined) months ago, I finished up a one-year creative residency with Adobe, where I got to focus full-time on a passion project alongside eight other creators around the world. During my residency, I set out on a mission to reduce food waste by designing circular product solutions. Among creating digital products in the realm of food sharing, food access, and urban zero waste, I led talks and workshops at events including Seattle Interactive, AIGA, Adobe MAX, and DesignX. <br><br>Prior to my residency, I spent two years at Microsoft as a UX-focused Program Manager after graduating from Tufts University. At school, I studied a self-made major called Innovation &amp; Design Thinking and took a semester off to work at IDEO on the future of food. <br></p></div><div class="w-col w-col-6"><p class="body-light">There, I had the opportunity to hone my craft and learn the value of design research and rapid prototyping from global design leaders.<br><br>In addition to freelancing, I've been exploring circularity as a participant in the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s From Linear to Circular Programme. I've also been working on a product venture, Farewell, aimed at increasing compost participation in NYC.<br><br>Outside of my day job, I enjoy cooking, woodworking, or hiking in search of Chanterelle mushrooms, a Pacific Northwest dream of mine. When I'm not quarantining, you can find me visiting family where I grew up in New York or hosting a gathering with friends for a home cooked meal. At my core is a love for bringing people together through design and food, and building community. <br></p></div></div>

Previously, I studied at Pembroke College, Oxford University and Tufts University, where I graduated summa cum laude with a double major in Economics and Environmental Studies. I was also selected a [Tufts Senior Award Winner](https://alumniandfriends.tufts.edu/join-our-community/about-alumni-association/2019-senior-awards-honorees)  and inducted into the [Phi Betta Kappa](https://ase.tufts.edu/pbk/index_files/Page352.htm) honors society.

I'm interested in the power of law to create a more just, sustainable, and equitable economy. I've written extensively on social justice topics at the intersection of law and business, such as climate risk and employee ownership. To learn more about these and other topics, please peruse my writings [here](/blog)

Outside of my professional life, I love cooking and experimenting with various fermented foods.

* Worked on a small-scale organic farm in Ecuador; 
* Learned to unicycle;
